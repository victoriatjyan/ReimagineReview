0,PREreview,"At PREreview we strive to provide systematically disadvantaged researchers better ways to build skills to engage in scholarly peer review and have their voice heard. Our work is a direct response to the flawed way scientific research is evaluated. Behind closed doors, a handful of unpaid reviewers—selected opaquely and mainly through personal connections—use subjective criteria to decide the fate of a research article. This arcane process is slow and disadvantages researchers from historically underrepresented groups.

We envision a future in which every researcher is empowered with the skills to recognize and challenge bias, and is welcomed into a peer review culture where constructive feedback is expected and rewarded. We build training programs, host events and hold space for debate-based learning, and build open infrastructure to host open rapid and long-form reviews of preprints.",Active,Preprints,Open identities|Open interaction|Open reports|Single blind,Free-form commenting|Structured review form,Comment indexing|Comment moderation|Comment rating (meta-evaluation)|Post-publication review,All disciplines|Life Sciences,Authors|Non-authors,Self-nominated,Complete paper,Editor or service,Not included,Included,Not included,Other scale or rating,Unverified

These specific communities are entitled PCI X, e.g. PCI Evolutionary Biology, PCI Ecology, PCI Paleontology....
Once recommended by and editor of one of these PCIs on the basis of rigorous and transparent peer reviews, preprints become valid references and may be considered to be articles of high value. Recommended preprints can be used by scientists and cited in the scientific literature. There is no need for these recommended preprints to be submitted for publication in classic journals (although they can be, according to the authors’ preferences).

In a second stage, the peer-review process is completed and, if accepted, the final revised papers are published in the journal. All referee and editor reports, the authors' response, as well as the different manuscript versions of the post-discussion review of the revised submission, are published too.

16,Faculty Opinions,"Launched in 2002, Faculty Opinions(formerly F1000 Prime) is an article recommendations service. Faculty Opinions was designed to help researchers to navigate an expanding corpus of scholarly literature, providing an easy way for researchers to discover emerging content that might have relevance for their research and/or to support the formulation of new ideas and potential collaboration.  Faculty Opinions effectively provides an expert (peer) curated service of published research that 'shouldn't be missed'.

The faculty is a virtual collection of peer-nominated scientific experts (n=8000) from across the globe; Faculty Members (FMs) are required to write a short summary of the key interest points in any article that they find either interesting, novel, challenging (and other categories/classifiers of interest); alongside the summary , FMs provide a semantic rating - ‘Exceptional'; 'Very good'; 'Good’.

The recommendations provide by Faculty Opinions complement quantitative article-based citation metrics, providing a qualitative expert (human) view of the potential importance, interest and impact of a piece of research.   It is estimated that round 1.5-2% of articles in PubMed are recommended in Faculty Opinions per annum.  All recommendations receive a DOI and are fully citable thus allowing transparency and visibility of the peer review activity involved and the recommendations to potentially inform other research; all articles receiving a recommendation in Faculty Opinions are flagged in the article Crossref record.  We are working hard to secure ORCIS ids for all FMs and already push recommendations to an individual ORICD id to help provide recogntion of the efforts of FMs.

Traditionally, the audience and subscriber base for Faculty Opinions has been Research and Institution Libraries.  Latterly, Faculty Opinions is used by funding agencies and Institutions to support research impact assessment, evaluation and practical services such as peer review selection and grant management.

Currently Faculty Opinions is a service focusing on recommendations in the life and medical sciences; however during 2019 Faculty Opinions 's scope is being broadened to cover psychology and the physical sciences with more to come.

51,Researchers.One,"The primary goal of researchers.one is to facilitate high quality scholarship without
the pitfalls of a “guild-like” system. Specifically, researchers.one separates the <em>scholarly</em> aspects of peer review from the <em>administrative</em> by offering researchers the 3 A’s:

 	<li><strong>Autonomy</strong> to pursue their passions,</li>
 	<li><strong>Authority</strong> to develop and disseminate their ideas and</li>
 	<li><strong>Access</strong> to engage with the international community of scholars.</li>
</ul>
Some basic attributes of the platform include: there are no editors, there are no
accept-reject decisions or other barriers to publication, and there are no barriers to access. In removing these barriers, the researchers.one autonomous publishing model gives authors total control over the publication process from start to finish, which includes selecting the mode of peer review (public access or traditional), choosing the invited reviewers (if traditional peer review is chosen), determining whether and how to address reviewer comments, and deciding whether or not to publish their work. Once published, articles are publicly accessible on the site, with options for other users to provide non-anonymous commentary and post-publication peer review. Ultimately, the quality of published work must stand on its own, without the crutch of impact factors, journal prestige, ‘likes’, ‘thumbs up’, or the artificial stamp of approval signaled by the label ‘peer review’.",Active,Other scholarly outputs|Preprints|Privately shared manuscripts,Open interaction|Open participation|Open reports,Free-form commenting,Post-publication review|Pre-publication review|Preregistration,All disciplines,Non-authors,Self-nominated,Complete paper|Specific aspects,Editor or service,Not included,Included,Included,None,Unverified

56,Red Team Market,"We provide a service that provides independent criticism of research in the social sciences.

Early research established the feasibility of paying independent scientists to criticize research. In a pilot - the “Red Team Challenge” - we offered financial incentives to five scientists to find errors in a submission-ready manuscript. Critics found 107 issues, some of which were so substantial that the author delayed submission and ran an additional experiment. Since then, we have developed a database of professional critics and have conducted projects to provide rapid, independent criticism on a wide range of projects. We have also recently begun to provide independent analyses of scientific fraud.

Our service works as follows. Any individual who wishes to receive independent expert feedback or critical evaluation of work in the social sciences can contact us with their aim and budget. We work together to determine an appropriate time frame and to find independent critics who are able to complete the work. Critics sign a confidentiality agreement and a contract specifying terms and expected output. Critics then provide independent evaluations of the research - whether a research plan, manuscript, or published paper. We review critics' comments for professionalism, add our own evaluations (when applicable), and generate a professional final report.

57,Crowd preprint review,"While there is increasing interest in preprint review activities, the level of public commenting and reviewing on preprints remains low overall. To explore review modalities that may foster participation in preprint review, we are adapting the crowd review <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/546009a"">model</a> pioneered by the journal Synlett to preprints, and are running a trial to learn whether this approach provides an engaging format for researchers to participate in preprint feedback and contribute to public preprint reviews.

The Crowd preprint review trial involves bioRxiv preprints in cell biology which authors have requested feedback on. We will coordinate a group of researchers in cell biology interested in contributing feedback – the Crowd. During the trial, we will circulate a preprint or two weekly to the Crowd, and will invite members to provide comments via a Hypothes.is group; Crowd members can comment on the full paper or parts of the study according to their interest. After seven days, we will close the commenting period and generate a collective synthesis of the comments to be posted as a public review.

58,PubPeer,"The process of reviewing published science is constantly occurring and is now commonly being called post-publication peer review. It occurs in many places including on blogs such as this one, review articles, at conferences around the world, and has even been encouraged on the websites of some journals. However, the process of recording and searching these comments is, unfortunately, inefficient and underused by the larger scientific community for several reasons: To successfully impact the publication process, this database of knowledge has to accomplish two important tasks. First it requires participation by a large part of a given scientific community so that it reflects an average impression instead of an outlier’s impression. Second, it requires that the collective knowledge is centralized and easy to search in order find out what the community collectively thinks about an individual paper or a body of work. A recent initiative, the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), echoes many of these same concerns.

In an attempt to assemble such a database, a team of scientists, have put together a website called PubPeer.com that is searchable and encourages participation by the larger scientific community.
